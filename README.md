1. Application Requirements
Questions:
	• What type of application is it (e.g., web app, mobile backend, database, batch processing)?
	• What is the expected usage pattern (e.g., steady, unpredictable, or cyclical)?
	• Are there any latency or performance requirements?
	• Does the application require high availability or fault tolerance?
	• Is the application stateful or stateless?
	• What programming language or frameworks are used?
	• Are there specific software dependencies or licenses required?
	• What is the expected deployment timeline?
Information Needed:
	• Application architecture (e.g., monolithic, microservices).
	• Performance benchmarks (e.g., response times, throughput).
	• Dependencies (e.g., Java, Node.js, .NET).

2. Compute and Resource Needs
Questions:
	• What is the expected workload (e.g., CPU, memory, storage needs)?
	• Does the application require specific instance types (e.g., GPU for ML/AI workloads)?
	• How many environments are needed (e.g., dev, staging, production)?
	• Is containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) planned?
	• Is auto-scaling required to handle variable workloads?
	• Do you require specific AMIs, or can we use AWS-provided AMIs?
Information Needed:
	• Resource requirements (vCPUs, memory, storage type: SSD, EBS).
	• Need for reserved, on-demand, or spot instances.
	• Preferences for EC2, ECS/EKS, or AWS Lambda (serverless).

3. Networking Requirements
Questions:
	• Does the application need to be publicly accessible (e.g., web app) or private?
	• What are the connectivity requirements (e.g., VPC, VPN, Direct Connect)?
	• Are there specific IP address ranges or subnets required?
	• Do you need custom DNS entries or domains?
	• Are there compliance needs for secure networking (e.g., encryption, private endpoints)?
Information Needed:
	• VPC design (subnets: public/private, region selection).
	• Load balancing requirements (e.g., ALB, NLB).
	• Security group and network ACL rules.

4. Storage and Database Needs
Questions:
	• Does the application need persistent storage?
	• How much data will the application store, and how fast is it expected to grow?
	• Are there specific storage types required (e.g., block, object, or file storage)?
	• Does the application use a database? If so, what type (e.g., SQL, NoSQL)?
	• Are there backup and disaster recovery requirements?
	• Are there existing datasets to migrate to AWS?
Information Needed:
	• Type of storage (EBS, S3, EFS).
	• Database selection (RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB).
	• Data lifecycle policies and encryption needs.

5. Security and Compliance
Questions:
	• Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?
	• Do you need identity and access control (IAM roles, policies)?
	• Should data be encrypted at rest and in transit?
	• Are there audit or logging requirements?
	• Will the application require WAF (Web Application Firewall) or DDoS protection?
Information Needed:
	• IAM roles and policies to restrict access.
	• Security best practices (e.g., TLS, KMS for encryption).
	• Logging requirements (e.g., CloudWatch, CloudTrail).

6. Monitoring and Maintenance
Questions:
	• Do you need real-time monitoring and alerts for the application?
	• Are there specific KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to monitor?
	• Do you need automated recovery or scaling?
	• What are the application SLA requirements?
Information Needed:
	• Monitoring tools (CloudWatch, third-party tools).
	• Alerts and incident response plans.
	• Metrics to track (e.g., CPU utilization, latency, disk I/O).

7. Budget and Cost Constraints
Questions:
	• What is your monthly or annual budget for the cloud infrastructure?
	• Are you open to cost-saving mechanisms like reserved instances or spot instances?
	• Should cost monitoring and reporting tools be implemented?
Information Needed:
	• Budget limits.
	• Strategies for cost optimization (e.g., auto-scaling, rightsizing).
	• Preference for AWS Savings Plans or Reserved Instances.

8. Migration and Integration Needs
Questions:
	• Are there existing workloads or applications to migrate to AWS?
	• Does the application need to integrate with third-party systems or on-premises resources?
	• Do you have existing CI/CD pipelines for application deployment?
Information Needed:
	• Migration tools needed (AWS Migration Hub, DMS).
	• Integration details (e.g., APIs, hybrid connectivity).
	• CI/CD tools (CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitLab).

9. Regional and Global Distribution
Questions:
	• Where are your end-users located (regionally or globally)?
	• Do you need content delivery (e.g., AWS CloudFront)?
	• Do you need a multi-region or failover setup for high availability?
Information Needed:
	• Preferred AWS regions.
	• Latency considerations and regional compliance needs.
